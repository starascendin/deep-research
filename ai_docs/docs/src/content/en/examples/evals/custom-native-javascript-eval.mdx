# Custom Native JavaScript Evaluation

<ScorerCallout />

This example shows how to create a custom evaluation metric using JavaScript logic. The metric accepts a `query` and a `response`, and returns a score and an `info` object containing the total and matched words.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mastra/evals
```

## Create a custom eval

A custom eval in Mastra can use native JavaScript methods to evaluate conditions.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/evals/example-word-inclusion.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Metric, type MetricResult } from "@mastra/core";

export class WordInclusionMetric extends Metric {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  async measure(input: string, output: string): Promise<MetricResult> {
    const tokenize = (text: string) => text.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+\b/g) || [];

    const referenceWords = [...new Set(tokenize(input))];
    const outputText = output.toLowerCase();

    const matchedWords = referenceWords.filter((word) => outputText.includes(word));

    const totalWords = referenceWords.length;
    const score = totalWords > 0 ? matchedWords.length / totalWords : 0;

    return {
      score,
      info: {
        totalWords,
        matchedWords: matchedWords.length
      }
    };
  }
}
```

## High custom example

In this example, the response contains all the words listed in the input query. The metric returns a high score indicating complete word inclusion.

```typescript filename="src/example-high-word-inclusion.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { WordInclusionMetric } from "./mastra/evals/example-word-inclusion";

const metric = new WordInclusionMetric();

const query = "apple, banana, orange";
const response = "My favorite fruits are: apple, banana, and orange.";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### High custom output

The output receives a high score because all the unique words from the input are present in the response, demonstrating full coverage.

```typescript
{
  score: 1,
  info: {
    totalWords: 3,
    matchedWords: 3
  }
}
```

## Partial custom example

In this example, the response includes some but not all of the words from the input query. The metric returns a partial score reflecting this incomplete word coverage.

```typescript filename="src/example-partial-word-inclusion.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { WordInclusionMetric } from "./mastra/evals/example-word-inclusion";

const metric = new WordInclusionMetric();

const query = "cats, dogs, rabbits";
const response = "I like dogs and rabbits";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### Partial custom output

The score reflects partial success because the response contains only a subset of the unique words from the input, indicating incomplete word inclusion.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.6666666666666666,
  info: {
    totalWords: 3,
    matchedWords: 2
  }
}
```

## Low custom example

In this example, the response does not contain any of the words from the input query. The metric returns a low score indicating no word inclusion.

```typescript filename="src/example-low-word-inclusion.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { WordInclusionMetric } from "./mastra/evals/example-word-inclusion";

const metric = new WordInclusionMetric();

const query = "Colombia, Brazil, Panama";
const response = "Let's go to Mexico";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### Low custom output

The score is 0 because none of the unique words from the input appear in the response, indicating no overlap between the texts.

```typescript
{
  score: 0,
  info: {
    totalWords: 3,
    matchedWords: 0
  }
}
```

## Understanding the results

`WordInclusionMetric` returns a result in the following shape:

```typescript
{
  score: number,
  info: {
    totalWords: number,
    matchedWords: number
  }
}
```

### Custom score

A score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: The response includes all words from the input.
- **0.5â€“0.9**: The response includes some but not all words.
- **0.0**: None of the input words appear in the response.

### Custom info

An explanation for the score, with details including:

- `totalWords` is the number of unique words found in the input.
- `matchedWords` is the count of those words that also appear in the response.
- The score is calculated as `matchedWords / totalWords`.
- If no valid words are found in the input, the score defaults to `0`.
