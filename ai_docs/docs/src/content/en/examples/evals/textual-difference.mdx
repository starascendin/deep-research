# Textual Difference Evaluation

<ScorerCallout />

Use `TextualDifferenceMetric` to evaluate the similarity between two text strings by analyzing sequence differences and edit operations. The metric accepts a `query` and a `response`, and returns a score and an `info` object containing confidence, ratio, number of changes, and length difference.

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/evals
```

## No differences example

In this example, the texts are exactly the same. The metric identifies complete similarity with a perfect score and no detected changes.


```typescript filename="src/example-no-differences.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { TextualDifferenceMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new TextualDifferenceMetric();

const query = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
const response = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### No differences output

The metric returns a high score, indicating the texts are identical. The detailed info confirms zero changes and no length difference.

```typescript
{
  score: 1,
  info: {
    confidence: 1,
    ratio: 1,
    changes: 0,
    lengthDiff: 0
  }
}
```
## Minor differences example

In this example, the texts have small variations. The metric detects these minor differences and returns a moderate similarity score.

```typescript filename="src/example-minor-differences.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { TextualDifferenceMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new TextualDifferenceMetric();

const query = "Hello world! How are you?";
const response = "Hello there! How is it going?";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### Minor differences output

The metric returns a moderate score reflecting the small variations between the texts. The detailed info includes the number of changes and length difference observed.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.5925925925925926,
  info: {
    confidence: 0.8620689655172413,
    ratio: 0.5925925925925926,
    changes: 5,
    lengthDiff: 0.13793103448275862
  }
}
```

## Major differences example

In this example, the texts differ significantly. The metric detects extensive changes and returns a low similarity score.

```typescript filename="src/example-major-differences.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { TextualDifferenceMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new TextualDifferenceMetric();

const query = "Python is a high-level programming language.";
const response = "JavaScript is used for web development";

const result = await metric.measure(query, response);

console.log(result);
```

### Major differences output

The metric returns a low score due to significant differences between the texts. The detailed info shows numerous changes and a notable length difference.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.3170731707317073,
  info: {
    confidence: 0.8636363636363636,
    ratio: 0.3170731707317073,
    changes: 8,
    lengthDiff: 0.13636363636363635
  }
}
```

## Metric configuration

You can create a `TextualDifferenceMetric` instance with default settings. No additional configuration is required.

```typescript
const metric = new TextualDifferenceMetric();
```

> See [TextualDifferenceMetric](/reference/evals/textual-difference.mdx) for a full list of configuration options.

## Understanding the results

`TextualDifferenceMetric` returns a result in the following shape:

```typescript
{
  score: number,
  info: {
    confidence: number,
    ratio: number,
    changes: number,
    lengthDiff: number
  }
}
```

### Textual difference score

A textual difference score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: Identical texts – no differences detected.
- **0.7–0.9**: Minor differences – few changes needed.
- **0.4–0.6**: Moderate differences – noticeable changes required.
- **0.1–0.3**: Major differences – extensive changes needed.
- **0.0**: Completely different texts.

### Textual difference info

An explanation for the score, with details including:

- Confidence level based on text length comparison.
- Similarity ratio derived from sequence matching.
- Number of edit operations required to match texts.
- Normalized difference in text lengths.
