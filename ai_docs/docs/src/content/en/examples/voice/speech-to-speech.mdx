# Call Analysis with Mastra

This guide demonstrates how to build a complete voice conversation system with analytics using Mastra. The example includes real-time speech-to-speech conversation, recording management, and integration with Roark Analytics for call analysis.

## Overview

The system creates a voice conversation with a Mastra agent, records the entire interaction, uploads the recording to Cloudinary for storage, and then sends the conversation data to Roark Analytics for detailed call analysis.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. OpenAI API key for speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
2. Cloudinary account for audio file storage
3. Roark Analytics API key for call analysis

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file based on the sample provided:

```bash filename="speech-to-speech/call-analysis/sample.env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
ROARK_API_KEY=
```

### Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash copy
npm install
```

## Implementation

### Creating the Mastra Agent

First, we define our agent with voice capabilities:

```ts filename="speech-to-speech/call-analysis/src/mastra/agents/index.ts" copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { OpenAIRealtimeVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai-realtime";
import { z } from "zod";

// Have the agent do something
export const speechToSpeechServer = new Agent({
  name: "mastra",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  voice: new OpenAIRealtimeVoice(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  tools: {
    salutationTool: createTool({
      id: "salutationTool",
      description: "Read the result of the tool",
      inputSchema: z.object({ name: z.string() }),
      outputSchema: z.object({ message: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ context }) => {
        return { message: `Hello ${context.name}!` };
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### Initializing Mastra

Register the agent with Mastra:

```ts filename="speech-to-speech/call-analysis/src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { speechToSpeechServer } from "./agents";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: {
    speechToSpeechServer,
  },
});
```

### Cloudinary Integration for Audio Storage

Set up Cloudinary for storing the recorded audio files:

```ts filename="speech-to-speech/call-analysis/src/upload.ts" copy
import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

export async function uploadToCloudinary(path: string) {
  const response = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(path, {
    resource_type: "raw",
  });
  console.log(response);
  return response.url;
}
```

### Main Application Logic

The main application orchestrates the conversation flow, recording, and analytics integration:

```ts filename="speech-to-speech/call-analysis/src/base.ts" copy
import { Roark } from "@roarkanalytics/sdk";
import chalk from "chalk";

import { mastra } from "./mastra";
import { createConversation, formatToolInvocations } from "./utils";
import { uploadToCloudinary } from "./upload";
import fs from "fs";

const client = new Roark({
  bearerToken: process.env.ROARK_API_KEY,
});

async function speechToSpeechServerExample() {
  const { start, stop } = createConversation({
    mastra,
    recordingPath: "./speech-to-speech-server.mp3",
    providerOptions: {},
    initialMessage: "Howdy partner",
    onConversationEnd: async (props) => {
      // File upload
      fs.writeFileSync(props.recordingPath, props.audioBuffer);
      const url = await uploadToCloudinary(props.recordingPath);

      // Send to Roark
      console.log("Send to Roark", url);
      const response = await client.callAnalysis.create({
        recordingUrl: url,
        startedAt: props.startedAt,
        callDirection: "INBOUND",
        interfaceType: "PHONE",
        participants: [
          {
            role: "AGENT",
            spokeFirst: props.agent.spokeFirst,
            name: props.agent.name,
            phoneNumber: props.agent.phoneNumber,
          },
          {
            role: "CUSTOMER",
            name: "Yujohn Nattrass",
            phoneNumber: "987654321",
          },
        ],
        properties: props.metadata,
        toolInvocations: formatToolInvocations(props.toolInvocations),
      });

      console.log("Call Recording Posted:", response.data);
    },
    onWriting: (ev) => {
      if (ev.role === "assistant") {
        process.stdout.write(chalk.blue(ev.text));
      }
    },
  });

  await start();

  process.on("SIGINT", async (e) => {
    await stop();
  });
}

speechToSpeechServerExample().catch(console.error);
```

## Conversation Utilities

The `utils.ts` file contains helper functions for managing the conversation, including:

1. Creating and managing the conversation session
2. Handling audio recording
3. Processing tool invocations
4. Managing conversation lifecycle events

## Running the Example

Start the conversation with:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

The application will:

1. Start a real-time voice conversation with the Mastra agent
2. Record the entire conversation
3. Upload the recording to Cloudinary when the conversation ends
4. Send the conversation data to Roark Analytics for analysis
5. Display the analysis results

## Key Features

- **Real-time Speech-to-Speech**: Uses OpenAI's voice models for natural conversation
- **Conversation Recording**: Captures the entire conversation for later analysis
- **Tool Invocation Tracking**: Records when and how AI tools are used during the conversation
- **Analytics Integration**: Sends conversation data to Roark Analytics for detailed analysis
- **Cloud Storage**: Uploads recordings to Cloudinary for secure storage and access

## Customization

You can customize this example by:

- Modifying the agent's instructions and capabilities
- Adding additional tools for the agent to use
- Changing the conversation flow or initial message
- Extending the analytics integration with custom metadata
