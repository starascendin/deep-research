# Textual Difference Scorer

Use `createTextualDifferenceScorer` to evaluate the similarity between two text strings by analyzing sequence differences and edit operations.

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/evals
```

> For complete API documentation and configuration options, see [`createTextualDifferenceScorer`](/reference/scorers/textual-difference).

## No differences example

In this example, the texts are exactly the same. The scorer identifies complete similarity with a perfect score and no detected changes.

```typescript filename="src/example-no-differences.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createTextualDifferenceScorer } from "@mastra/evals/scorers/code";

const scorer = createTextualDifferenceScorer();

const input = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog';
const output = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog';

const result = await scorer.run({
  input: [{ role: 'user', content: input }],
  output: { role: 'assistant', text: output },
});

console.log('Score:', result.score);
console.log('AnalyzeStepResult:', result.analyzeStepResult);
```

### No differences output

The scorer returns a high score, indicating the texts are identical. The detailed info confirms zero changes and no length difference.

```typescript
{
  score: 1,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    confidence: 1,
    ratio: 1,
    changes: 0,
    lengthDiff: 0,
  },
}
```

## Minor differences example

In this example, the texts have small variations. The scorer detects these minor differences and returns a moderate similarity score.

```typescript filename="src/example-minor-differences.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createTextualDifferenceScorer } from "@mastra/evals/scorers/code";

const scorer = createTextualDifferenceScorer();

const input = 'Hello world! How are you?';
const output = 'Hello there! How is it going?';

const result = await scorer.run({
  input: [{ role: 'user', content: input }],
  output: { role: 'assistant', text: output },
});

console.log('Score:', result.score);
console.log('AnalyzeStepResult:', result.analyzeStepResult);
```

### Minor differences output

The scorer returns a moderate score reflecting the small variations between the texts. The detailed info includes the number of changes and length difference observed.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.5925925925925926,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    confidence: 0.8620689655172413,
    ratio: 0.5925925925925926,
    changes: 5,
    lengthDiff: 0.13793103448275862
  }
}
```

## Major differences example

In this example, the texts differ significantly. The scorer detects extensive changes and returns a low similarity score.

```typescript filename="src/example-major-differences.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createTextualDifferenceScorer } from "@mastra/evals/scorers/code";

const scorer = createTextualDifferenceScorer();

const input = 'Python is a high-level programming language';
const output = 'JavaScript is used for web development';

const result = await scorer.run({
  input: [{ role: 'user', content: input }],
  output: { role: 'assistant', text: output },
});

console.log('Score:', result.score);
console.log('AnalyzeStepResult:', result.analyzeStepResult);
```

### Major differences output

The scorer returns a low score due to significant differences between the texts. The detailed `analyzeStepResult` shows numerous changes and a notable length difference.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.3170731707317073,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    confidence: 0.8636363636363636,
    ratio: 0.3170731707317073,
    changes: 8,
    lengthDiff: 0.13636363636363635
  }
}
```

## Scorer configuration

You can create a `TextualDifferenceScorer` instance with default settings. No additional configuration is required.

```typescript
const scorer = createTextualDifferenceScorer();
```

> See [TextualDifferenceScorer](/reference/scorers/textual-difference.mdx) for a full list of configuration options.

## Understanding the results

`.run()` returns a result in the following shape:

```typescript
{
  runId: string,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    confidence: number,
    ratio: number,
    changes: number,
    lengthDiff: number
  },
  score: number
}
```

### score
A textual difference score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: Identical texts – no differences detected.
- **0.7–0.9**: Minor differences – few changes needed.
- **0.4–0.6**: Moderate differences – noticeable changes required.
- **0.1–0.3**: Major differences – extensive changes needed.
- **0.0**: Completely different texts.

### runId
The unique identifier for this scorer run.

### analyzeStepResult
Object with difference metrics:
- **confidence**: Confidence score based on length difference (higher is better).
- **ratio**: Similarity ratio between the texts (0-1).
- **changes**: Number of edit operations required to match the texts.
- **lengthDiff**: Normalized difference in text lengths.
