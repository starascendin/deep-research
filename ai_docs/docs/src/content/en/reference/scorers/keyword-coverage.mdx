# Keyword Coverage Scorer

The `createKeywordCoverageScorer()` function evaluates how well an LLM's output covers the important keywords from the input. It analyzes keyword presence and matches while ignoring common words and stop words.

For a usage example, see the [Keyword Coverage Examples](/examples/scorers/keyword-coverage).

## Parameters

The `createKeywordCoverageScorer()` function does not take any options.

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. See the [MastraScorer reference](./mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## .run() Returns

## Scoring Details

The scorer evaluates keyword coverage by matching keywords with the following features:

- Common word and stop word filtering (e.g., "the", "a", "and")
- Case-insensitive matching
- Word form variation handling
- Special handling of technical terms and compound words

### Scoring Process

1. Processes keywords from input and output:
   - Filters out common words and stop words
   - Normalizes case and word forms
   - Handles special terms and compounds
2. Calculates keyword coverage:
   - Matches keywords between texts
   - Counts successful matches
   - Computes coverage ratio

Final score: `(matched_keywords / total_keywords) * scale`

### Score interpretation

(0 to scale, default 0-1)

- 1.0: Perfect keyword coverage
- 0.7-0.9: Good coverage with most keywords present
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate coverage with some keywords missing
- 0.1-0.3: Poor coverage with many keywords missing
- 0.0: No keyword matches

## Special Cases

The scorer handles several special cases:

- Empty input/output: Returns score of 1.0 if both empty, 0.0 if only one is empty
- Single word: Treated as a single keyword
- Technical terms: Preserves compound technical terms (e.g., "React.js", "machine learning")
- Case differences: "JavaScript" matches "javascript"
- Common words: Ignored in scoring to focus on meaningful keywords
