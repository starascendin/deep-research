# afterEvent()

The `afterEvent()` method creates a suspension point in your workflow that waits for a specific event to occur before continuing execution.

## Syntax

```typescript
workflow.afterEvent(eventName: string): Workflow
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eventName | string | The name of the event to wait for. Must match an event defined in the workflow's `events` configuration. |

## Return Value

Returns the workflow instance for method chaining.

## Description

The `afterEvent()` method is used to create an automatic suspension point in your workflow that waits for a specific named event. It's essentially a declarative way to define a point where your workflow should pause and wait for an external event to occur.

When you call `afterEvent()`, Mastra:

1. Creates a special step with ID `__eventName_event`
2. This step automatically suspends the workflow execution
3. The workflow remains suspended until the specified event is triggered via `resumeWithEvent()`
4. When the event occurs, execution continues with the step following the `afterEvent()` call

This method is part of Mastra's event-driven workflow capabilities, allowing you to create workflows that coordinate with external systems or user interactions without manually implementing suspension logic.

## Usage Notes

- The event specified in `afterEvent()` must be defined in the workflow's `events` configuration with a schema
- The special step created has a predictable ID format: `__eventName_event` (e.g., `__approvalReceived_event`)
- Any step following `afterEvent()` can access the event data via `context.inputData.resumedEvent`
- Event data is validated against the schema defined for that event when `resumeWithEvent()` is called

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

// Define workflow with events
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "approval-workflow",
  events: {
    approval: {
      schema: z.object({
        approved: z.boolean(),
        approverName: z.string(),
      }),
    },
  },
});

// Build workflow with event suspension point
workflow
  .step(submitRequest)
  .afterEvent("approval") // Workflow suspends here
  .step(processApproval) // This step runs after the event occurs
  .commit();
```
