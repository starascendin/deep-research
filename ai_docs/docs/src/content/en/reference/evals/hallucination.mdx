# HallucinationMetric

<ScorerCallout />

The `HallucinationMetric` evaluates whether an LLM generates factually correct information by comparing its output against the provided context. This metric measures hallucination by identifying direct contradictions between the context and the output.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { HallucinationMetric } from "@mastra/evals/llm";

// Configure the model for evaluation
const model = openai("gpt-4o-mini");

const metric = new HallucinationMetric(model, {
  context: [
    "Tesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in San Carlos, California.",
  ],
});

const result = await metric.measure(
  "Tell me about Tesla's founding.",
  "Tesla was founded in 2004 by Elon Musk in California.",
);

console.log(result.score); // Score from 0-1
console.log(result.info.reason); // Explanation of the score

// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.67,
//   info: {
//     reason: "The score is 0.67 because two out of three statements from the context
//           (founding year and founders) were contradicted by the output, while the
//           location statement was not contradicted."
//   }
// }
```

## Scoring Details

The metric evaluates hallucination through contradiction detection and unsupported claim analysis.

### Scoring Process

1. Analyzes factual content:

   - Extracts statements from context
   - Identifies numerical values and dates
   - Maps statement relationships

2. Analyzes output for hallucinations:

   - Compares against context statements
   - Marks direct conflicts as hallucinations
   - Identifies unsupported claims as hallucinations
   - Evaluates numerical accuracy
   - Considers approximation context

3. Calculates hallucination score:
   - Counts hallucinated statements (contradictions and unsupported claims)
   - Divides by total statements
   - Scales to configured range

Final score: `(hallucinated_statements / total_statements) * scale`

### Important Considerations

- Claims not present in context are treated as hallucinations
- Subjective claims are hallucinations unless explicitly supported
- Speculative language ("might", "possibly") about facts IN context is allowed
- Speculative language about facts NOT in context is treated as hallucination
- Empty outputs result in zero hallucinations
- Numerical evaluation considers:
  - Scale-appropriate precision
  - Contextual approximations
  - Explicit precision indicators

### Score interpretation

(0 to scale, default 0-1)

- 1.0: Complete hallucination - contradicts all context statements
- 0.75: High hallucination - contradicts 75% of context statements
- 0.5: Moderate hallucination - contradicts half of context statements
- 0.25: Low hallucination - contradicts 25% of context statements
- 0.0: No hallucination - output aligns with all context statements

**Note:** The score represents the degree of hallucination - lower scores indicate better factual alignment with the provided context

## Example with Analysis

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { HallucinationMetric } from "@mastra/evals/llm";

// Configure the model for evaluation
const model = openai("gpt-4o-mini");

const metric = new HallucinationMetric(model, {
  context: [
    "OpenAI was founded in December 2015 by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and others.",
    "The company launched with a $1 billion investment commitment.",
    "Elon Musk was an early supporter but left the board in 2018.",
  ],
});

const result = await metric.measure({
  input: "What are the key details about OpenAI?",
  output:
    "OpenAI was founded in 2015 by Elon Musk and Sam Altman with a $2 billion investment.",
});

// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.33,
//   info: {
//     reason: "The score is 0.33 because one out of three statements from the context
//           was contradicted (the investment amount was stated as $2 billion instead
//           of $1 billion). The founding date was correct, and while the output's
//           description of founders was incomplete, it wasn't strictly contradictory."
//   }
// }
```
