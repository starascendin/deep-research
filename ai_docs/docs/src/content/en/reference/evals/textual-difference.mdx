# TextualDifferenceMetric

<ScorerCallout />

The `TextualDifferenceMetric` class uses sequence matching to measure the textual differences between two strings. It provides detailed information about changes, including the number of operations needed to transform one text into another.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { TextualDifferenceMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new TextualDifferenceMetric();

const result = await metric.measure(
  "The quick brown fox",
  "The fast brown fox",
);

console.log(result.score); // Similarity ratio from 0-1
console.log(result.info); // Detailed change metrics
```

## measure() Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "string",
      description: "The original text to compare against",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "output",
      type: "string",
      description: "The text to evaluate for differences",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

    {
      name: "score",

    },
    {
      name: "info",

            },
          ],
        },

            },
          ],
        },
        {
          type: "number",

              type: "number",
              description:
                "Number of change operations (insertions, deletions, replacements)",
            },
          ],
        },
        {
          type: "number",
          parameters: [
            {
              name: "lengthDiff",
              type: "number",
              description:
                "Normalized difference in length between input and output (0-1)",
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

## Scoring Details

The metric calculates several measures:

- **Similarity Ratio**: Based on sequence matching between texts (0-1)
- **Changes**: Count of non-matching operations needed
- **Length Difference**: Normalized difference in text lengths
- **Confidence**: Inversely proportional to length difference

### Scoring Process

1. Analyzes textual differences:

   - Performs sequence matching between input and output
   - Counts the number of change operations required
   - Measures length differences

2. Calculates metrics:
   - Computes similarity ratio
   - Determines confidence score
   - Combines into weighted score

Final score: `(similarity_ratio * confidence) * scale`

### Score interpretation

(0 to scale, default 0-1)

- 1.0: Identical texts - no differences
- 0.7-0.9: Minor differences - few changes needed
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate differences - significant changes
- 0.1-0.3: Major differences - extensive changes
- 0.0: Completely different texts

## Example with Analysis

```typescript
import { TextualDifferenceMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new TextualDifferenceMetric();

const result = await metric.measure(
  "Hello world! How are you?",
  "Hello there! How is it going?",
);

// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.65,
//   info: {
//     confidence: 0.95,
//     ratio: 0.65,
//     changes: 2,
//     lengthDiff: 0.05
//   }
// }
```
