# getScorer()

The `getScorer()` method retrieves a specific scorer that was registered with the Mastra instance using its registration key. This method provides type-safe access to scorers and throws an error if the requested scorer is not found.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { mastra } from './mastra';

// Get a specific scorer by key
const relevancyScorer = mastra.getScorer('relevancyScorer');

const weatherAgent = mastra.getAgent('weatherAgent')

// Use the scorer to evaluate an AI output
await weatherAgent.generate('What is the weather in Rome', {
  scorers: {
    answerRelevancy: {
      scorer: relevancyScorer,
    },
  },
});
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "key",
      type: "string",
      description: "The registration key of the scorer to retrieve. This should match a key used when registering scorers in the Mastra constructor.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "scorer",
      type: "MastraScorer",
      description: "The MastraScorer instance associated with the provided key.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Error Handling

This method throws a `MastraError` if:
- The scorer with the specified key is not found
- No scorers are registered with the Mastra instance

```typescript
try {
  const scorer = mastra.getScorer('nonExistentScorer');
} catch (error) {
  if (error.id === 'MASTRA_GET_SCORER_NOT_FOUND') {
    console.log('Scorer not found, using default evaluation');
  }
}
```
