# Dash0

Dash0, an Open Telemetry native observability solution that provides full-stack monitoring capabilities as well as integrations with other CNCF projects like Perses and Prometheus.

## Configuration

To use Dash0 with Mastra, configure these environment variables:

```env
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingress.<region>.dash0.com
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=Authorization=Bearer <your-auth-token>, Dash0-Dataset=<optional-dataset>
```

## Implementation

Here's how to configure Mastra to use Dash0:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "your-service-name",
    enabled: true,
    export: {
      type: "otlp",
    },
  },
});
```
