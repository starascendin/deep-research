# New Relic

New Relic is a comprehensive observability platform that supports OpenTelemetry (OTLP) for full-stack monitoring.

## Configuration

To use New Relic with Mastra via OTLP, configure these environment variables:

```env
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="api-key=your_license_key"
```

## Implementation

Here's how to configure Mastra to use New Relic:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "your-service-name",
    enabled: true,
    export: {
      type: "otlp",
    },
  },
});
```

## Dashboard

View your telemetry data in the New Relic One dashboard at [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)
