# Observability Overview

Mastra provides comprehensive observability features designed specifically for AI applications. Monitor LLM operations, trace agent decisions, and debug complex workflows with specialized tools that understand AI-specific patterns.

## Key Features

### Structured Logging
Debug applications with contextual logging:
- **Context propagation**: Automatic correlation with traces
- **Configurable levels**: Filter by severity in development and production

### AI Tracing
Specialized tracing for AI operations that captures:
- **LLM interactions**: Token usage, latency, prompts, and completions
- **Agent execution**: Decision paths, tool calls, and memory operations
- **Workflow steps**: Branching logic, parallel execution, and step outputs
- **Automatic instrumentation**: Zero-configuration tracing with decorators

### OTEL Tracing
Traditional distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry:
- **Standard OTLP protocol**: Compatible with existing observability infrastructure
- **HTTP and database instrumentation**: Automatic spans for common operations
- **Provider integrations**: Datadog, New Relic, Jaeger, and other OTLP collectors
- **Distributed context**: W3C Trace Context propagation

## Quick Start

Configure Observability in your Mastra instance:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/core";
import { LibSqlStorage } from "@mastra/libsql";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  logger: new PinoLogger(),
  observability: {
    default: { enabled: true }, // Enables AI Tracing
  },
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    url: "file:./mastra.db", // Storage is required for tracing
  }),
  telemetry: {
    enabled: true, // Enables OTEL Tracing
  }
});
```

With this basic setup, you will see Traces and Logs in both the Playground and in Mastra Cloud.

We also support various external tracing providers like Langfuse, Braintrust, and any OpenTelemetry-compatible platform (Datadog, New Relic, SigNoz, etc.). See more about this in the [AI Tracing](/docs/observability/ai-tracing.mdx) documentation.
