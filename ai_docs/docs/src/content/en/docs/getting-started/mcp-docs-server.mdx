# Mastra Docs Server

The `@mastra/mcp-docs-server` package provides direct access to Mastra’s full knowledge base, including documentation, code examples, blog posts, and changelogs, via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro). It works with Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Claude Code, or any tool that supports MCP.

These tools are designed to help agents retrieve precise, task-specific information — whether you're adding a feature to an agent, scaffolding a new project, or exploring how something works.

In this guide you'll learn how to add Mastra's MCP server to your AI tooling.

## Installation

### create-mastra

During the interactive [create-mastra](/reference/cli/create-mastra) wizard, choose one of your tools in the MCP step.

### Manual setup

If there are no specific instructions for your tool below, you may be able to add the MCP server with this common JSON configuration anyways.

```json copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mastra": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code CLI

Install using the terminal command:

```bash copy
claude mcp add mastra -- npx -y @mastra/mcp-docs-server
```

### Cursor

Install by clicking the button below:

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=mastra&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IEBtYXN0cmEvbWNwLWRvY3Mtc2VydmVyIn0%3D)

If you followed the automatic installation, you'll see a popup when you open cursor in the bottom left corner to prompt you to enable the Mastra Docs MCP Server.

### Visual Studio Code

1. Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace
2. Insert the following configuration:

    ```json copy
    {
      "servers": {
        "mastra": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@mastra/mcp-docs-server"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Once you installed the MCP server, you can use it like so:

1. Open VSCode settings.
2. Navigate to MCP settings.
3. Click "enable" on the Chat > MCP option.

      alt="Settings page of VSCode to enable MCP"
      width={800}
      className="rounded-lg"
    />

MCP only works in Agent mode in VSCode. Once you are in agent mode, open the `mcp.json` file and click the "start" button. Note that the "start" button will only appear if the `.vscode` folder containing `mcp.json` is in your workspace root, or the highest level of the in-editor file explorer.

/>

After starting the MCP server, click the tools button in the Copilot pane to see available tools.

### Windsurf

1. Open `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` in your editor
2. Insert the following configuration:

    ```json copy
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "mastra": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3. Save the configuration and restart Windsurf

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI tool questions about Mastra or instruct it to take actions. For these steps, it'll take the up-to-date information from Mastra's MCP server.

**Add features:**

- "Add evals to my agent and write tests"
- "Write me a workflow that does the following `[task]`"
- "Make a new tool that allows my agent to access `[3rd party API]`"

**Ask about integrations:**

- "Does Mastra work with the AI SDK?
  How can I use it in my `[React/Svelte/etc]` project?"
- "What's the latest Mastra news around MCP?"
- "Does Mastra support `[provider]` speech and voice APIs? Show me an example in my code of how I can use it."

**Debug or update existing code:**

- "I'm running into a bug with agent memory, have there been any related changes or bug fixes recently?"
- "How does working memory behave in Mastra and how can I use it to do `[task]`? It doesn't seem to work the way I expect."
- "I saw there are new workflow features, explain them to me and then update `[workflow]` to use them."

### Troubleshooting

1. **Server Not Starting**

   - Ensure [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npx) is installed and working.
   - Check for conflicting MCP servers.
   - Verify your configuration file syntax.

2. **Tool Calls Failing**
   - Restart the MCP server and/or your IDE.
   - Update to the latest version of your IDE.
