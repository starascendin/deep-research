      <b>New Scorer API</b>
      <p>
        We just released a new evals API called Scorers, with a more ergonomic
        API and more metadata stored for error analysis, and more flexibility to
        evaluate data structures. Itâ€™s fairly simple to migrate, but we will
        continue to support the existing Evals API.
