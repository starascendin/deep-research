# Congratulations!

You've successfully built your first Mastra agent with:

- A well-defined system prompt
- A custom tool for fetching transaction data
- Memory for maintaining context across conversations

This is just the beginning of what you can do with Mastra. Here are some ways you could extend your agent:

- Add more tools or use MCP to expand its capabilities (we will cover this in the next lesson)
- Implement more sophisticated memory storage
- Create a workflow that combines multiple agents
- Deploy your agent to a production environment

For more information and advanced features, check out the [Mastra documentation](https://mastra.ai/docs).

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, you'll learn how to integrate MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers with your Mastra agent to expand its capabilities even further. MCP servers allow your agent to access external data sources and APIs, making it even more powerful and versatile.
