# Understanding System Prompts

A good system prompt is crucial as it defines your agent's purpose, capabilities, and behavioral guidelines. It's the foundation that shapes how your agent will interact with users.

A well-crafted system prompt should include:

- **Role definition**: What the agent is and what it does
- **Core capabilities**: What tasks the agent can perform
- **Behavioral guidelines**: How the agent should respond and interact
- **Constraints**: What the agent should not do or discuss
- **Success criteria**: What makes the agent's responses good

The system prompt acts as a set of instructions that guide the agent's behavior. It helps the agent understand its purpose and how it should interact with users. A clear and comprehensive system prompt will result in more consistent and helpful agent responses.
