# Running the Playground

To test your agent as you build it, you'll need to run the Mastra playground:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the playground at `http://localhost:4111/`, where you can interact with your agent and test its capabilities.

The playground provides a user-friendly interface for testing your agent, allowing you to:

- Send messages to your agent
- See the agent's responses
- View the agent's thought process
- Test tools directly
- Debug any issues that arise

In the next step, we'll create our first agent with a simple system prompt and test it in the playground.
