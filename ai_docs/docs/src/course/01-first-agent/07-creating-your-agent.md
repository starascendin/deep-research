# Creating Your Agent

Let's create a simple agent that will help users analyze financial transaction data. We'll create a new file called `agents/financial-agent.ts`.

First, create the new agent file at src/mastra/agents/financial-agent.ts

Now add the necessary imports at the top of your file:

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
// We'll import our tool in a later step
```

Now, let's create our agent:

```typescript
export const financialAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Financial Assistant Agent",
  instructions: `ROLE DEFINITION
- You are a financial assistant that helps users analyze their transaction data.

  model: openai("gpt-4o"), // You can use "gpt-3.5-turbo" if you prefer
  tools: {}, // We'll add tools in a later step
});
```

This creates a financial assistant agent with a well-defined system prompt that outlines its role, capabilities, behavioral guidelines, constraints, and success criteria.
