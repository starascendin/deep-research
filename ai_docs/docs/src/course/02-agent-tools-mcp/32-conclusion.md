# Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully enhanced your Mastra agent with MCP servers, giving it powerful capabilities including:

1. Email and social media integration through Zapier
2. GitHub monitoring through the Composio GitHub MCP server
3. Tech news access through the Hacker News MCP server
4. Local file management through the Filesystem MCP server
5. Enhanced memory for personalized interactions

Your agent is now a versatile personal assistant that can help with a wide range of tasks. Feel free to experiment with different MCP servers and configurations to further enhance your agent's capabilities.

The power of MCP lies in its ability to connect your agent to a wide variety of external services and data sources without requiring you to write custom tool functions for each one. This modular approach makes it easy to add new capabilities to your agent as needed.

As you continue to develop your Mastra agent, consider exploring other MCP servers and tools that might be useful for your specific use case. The Mastra ecosystem is constantly growing, with new tools and capabilities being added regularly.
