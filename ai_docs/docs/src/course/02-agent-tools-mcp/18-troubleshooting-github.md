# Troubleshooting

If your agent can't access the GitHub tools, check:

1. That your GitHub MCP URL is correct in your environment variables
2. That you've properly authenticated with GitHub
3. That the tools are properly loaded by checking the Tools tab in the playground

Common issues include:

- Incorrect or missing environment variables
- Authentication issues with GitHub
- Permission problems with the repositories you're trying to access

If you're having trouble, try checking the console logs for any error messages related to the GitHub MCP server. These can provide valuable clues about what might be going wrong.

In the next step, we'll add the Hacker News MCP server to give your agent access to tech news and discussions.
