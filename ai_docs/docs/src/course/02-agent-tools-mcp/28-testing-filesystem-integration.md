# Testing the Filesystem Integration

Let's test the Filesystem integration:

1. Make sure your development server is running with `npm run dev`
2. Open the playground at http://localhost:4111/
3. Try asking your agent to perform Filesystem-related tasks, such as:
   - "Create a to-do list for me"
   - "Add 'Buy groceries' to my to-do list"
   - "Create a note about the meeting tomorrow"
   - "What's on my to-do list?"
   - "Read my meeting notes"

The first time you ask a Filesystem-related question, there might be a slight delay as the PNPX command installs and starts the server. Subsequent queries should be faster.

Testing your Filesystem integration helps ensure that your agent can properly access and use the Filesystem tools. When you ask your agent to create or manage notes and to-do lists, it should recognize the need to use the appropriate Filesystem tool and make the necessary API calls to read from or write to the file system.
