# Adding the Hacker News MCP Server

In this step, we'll add a Hacker News MCP server to our agent, which will give it access to tech news and discussions from Hacker News.

## What is the Hacker News MCP Server?

The Hacker News MCP server provides tools for accessing content from Hacker News, including:

- Retrieving top stories
- Searching for specific stories
- Staying updated on tech trends and news

By integrating the Hacker News MCP server with your Mastra agent, you can create an assistant that helps you stay informed about the latest developments in technology, programming, and startups. This is particularly useful for developers, tech enthusiasts, and professionals who want to keep up with industry trends and discussions.
