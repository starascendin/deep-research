# Adding the GitHub MCP Server

In this step, we'll add the Composio GitHub MCP server to our agent, which will give it the ability to monitor and interact with GitHub repositories.

## What is the GitHub MCP Server?

The GitHub MCP server provides tools for interacting with GitHub repositories, including:

- Monitoring repository activity
- Checking pull requests and issues
- Viewing commit history
- Summarizing development patterns

By integrating the GitHub MCP server with your Mastra agent, you can create an assistant that helps you stay on top of your GitHub repositories, track important changes, and get insights into development activity. This is particularly useful for developers and teams who want to monitor their projects without constantly checking GitHub manually.
