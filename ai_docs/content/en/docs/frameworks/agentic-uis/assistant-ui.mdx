# Using with Assistant UI

[Assistant UI](https://assistant-ui.com) is the TypeScript/React library for AI Chat.
Built on shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, it enables developers to create beautiful, enterprise-grade chat experiences in minutes.

<Callout type="info">
For a full-stack integration approach where Mastra runs directly in your Next.js API routes, see the [Full-Stack Integration Guide](https://www.assistant-ui.com/docs/runtimes/mastra/full-stack-integration) on Assistant UI's documentation site.

## Integration Guide

Run Mastra as a standalone server and connect your Next.js frontend (with Assistant UI) to its API endpoints.

<Steps>
### Create Standalone Mastra Server

Set up your directory structure. A possible directory structure could look like this:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="project-root" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="mastra-server" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="src">
                <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
            <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="nextjs-frontend">
            <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Bootstrap your Mastra server:

```bash copy
npx create-mastra@latest
```

This command will launch an interactive wizard to help you scaffold a new Mastra project, including prompting you for a project name and setting up basic configurations.
Follow the prompts to create your server project.

You now have a basic Mastra server project ready. You should have the following files and folders:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="agents" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="weather-agent.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="tools" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="weather-tool.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="workflows" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="weather-workflow.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Ensure that you have set the appropriate environment variables for your LLM provider in the `.env` file.
</Callout>

### Run the Mastra Server

Run the Mastra server using the following command:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

By default, the Mastra server will run on `http://localhost:4111`. Your `weatherAgent` should now be accessible via a POST request endpoint, typically `http://localhost:4111/api/agents/weatherAgent/stream`. Keep this server running for the next steps where we'll set up the Assistant UI frontend to connect to it.

### Initialize Assistant UI

Create a new `assistant-ui` project with the following command.

```bash copy
npx assistant-ui@latest create
```

<Callout>For detailed setup instructions, including adding API keys, basic configuration, and manual setup steps, please refer to [assistant-ui's official documentation](https://assistant-ui.com/docs).</Callout>

### Configure Frontend API Endpoint

The default Assistant UI setup configures the chat runtime to use a local API route (`/api/chat`) within the Next.js project. Since our Mastra agent is running on a separate server, we need to update the frontend to point to that server's endpoint.

Find the `useChatRuntime` hook in the `assistant-ui` project, typically at `app/assistant.tsx` and change the `api` property to the full URL of your Mastra agent's stream endpoint:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="app/assistant.tsx" {6}
import {
  useChatRuntime,
  AssistantChatTransport,
} from "@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk";

const runtime = useChatRuntime({
  transport: new AssistantChatTransport({
    api: "MASTRA_ENDPOINT",
  }),
});
```

Now, the Assistant UI frontend will send chat requests directly to your running Mastra server.

### Run the Application

You're ready to connect the pieces! Make sure both the Mastra server and the Assistant UI frontend are running. Start the Next.js development server:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to chat with your agent in the browser.

</Steps>

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Mastra with Assistant UI using a separate server approach. Your Assistant UI frontend now communicates with a standalone Mastra agent server.
