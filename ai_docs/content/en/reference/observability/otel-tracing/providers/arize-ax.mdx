# Arize AX

Arize AX is a comprehensive AI observability platform designed specifically for monitoring, evaluating, and improving LLM applications in production.

## Configuration

To use Arize AX with Mastra, you can configure it using either environment variables or directly in your Mastra configuration.

### Using Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

```env
ARIZE_SPACE_ID="your-space-id"
ARIZE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Getting Your Credentials

1. Sign up for an Arize AX account at [app.arize.com](https://app.arize.com)
2. Navigate to your space settings to find your Space ID and API Key

## Installation

First, install the OpenInference instrumentation package for Mastra:

```bash
npm install @arizeai/openinference-mastra
```

## Implementation

Here's how to configure Mastra to use Arize AX with OpenTelemetry:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import {
  isOpenInferenceSpan,
  OpenInferenceOTLPTraceExporter,
} from "@arizeai/openinference-mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "your-mastra-app",
    enabled: true,
    export: {
      type: "custom",
      exporter: new OpenInferenceOTLPTraceExporter({
        url: "https://otlp.arize.com/v1/traces",
        headers: {
          "space_id": process.env.ARIZE_SPACE_ID!,
          "api_key": process.env.ARIZE_API_KEY!,
        },
        spanFilter: isOpenInferenceSpan,
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

## What Gets Automatically Traced

Mastra's comprehensive tracing captures:

- **Agent Operations**: All agent generation, streaming, and interaction calls
- **LLM Interactions**: Complete model calls with input/output messages and metadata
- **Tool Executions**: Function calls made by agents with parameters and results
- **Workflow Runs**: Step-by-step workflow execution with timing and dependencies
- **Memory Operations**: Agent memory queries, updates, and retrieval operations

All traces follow OpenTelemetry standards and include relevant metadata such as model parameters, token usage, execution timing, and error details.

## Dashboard

Once configured, you can view your traces and analytics in the Arize AX dashboard at [app.arize.com](https://app.arize.com)
