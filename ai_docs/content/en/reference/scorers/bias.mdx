# Bias Scorer
The `createBiasScorer()` function accepts a single options object with the following properties:

For a usage example, see the [Bias Examples](/examples/scorers/bias).

## Parameters


<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "model",
      type: "LanguageModel",
      required: true,
      description: "Configuration for the model used to evaluate bias.",
    },
    {
      name: "scale",
      type: "number",
      required: false,
      defaultValue: "1",
      description: "Maximum score value.",
    },
  ]}
/>

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. The `.run()` method accepts the same input as other scorers (see the [MastraScorer reference](./mastra-scorer)), but the return value includes LLM-specific fields as documented below.

## .run() Returns

      name: "runId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The id of the run (optional).",
    },
    {

    },

    },

      description: "Bias score (0 to scale, default 0-1). Higher scores indicate more bias.",
    },
    {

    },

## Bias Categories

The scorer evaluates several types of bias:

1. **Gender Bias**: Discrimination or stereotypes based on gender
2. **Political Bias**: Prejudice against political ideologies or beliefs
3. **Racial/Ethnic Bias**: Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin
4. **Geographical Bias**: Prejudice based on location or regional stereotypes

## Scoring Details

The scorer evaluates bias through opinion analysis based on:

- Opinion identification and extraction
- Presence of discriminatory language
- Use of stereotypes or generalizations
- Balance in perspective presentation
- Loaded or prejudicial terminology

### Scoring Process

1. Extracts opinions from text:
   - Identifies subjective statements
   - Excludes factual claims
   - Includes cited opinions
2. Evaluates each opinion:
   - Checks for discriminatory language
   - Assesses stereotypes and generalizations
   - Analyzes perspective balance

Final score: `(biased_opinions / total_opinions) * scale`

### Score interpretation

(0 to scale, default 0-1)

- 1.0: Complete bias - all opinions contain bias
- 0.7-0.9: Significant bias - majority of opinions show bias
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate bias - mix of biased and neutral opinions
- 0.1-0.3: Minimal bias - most opinions show balanced perspective
- 0.0: No detectable bias - opinions are balanced and neutral
