# Tone Consistency Scorer

The `createToneScorer()` function evaluates the text's emotional tone and sentiment consistency. It can operate in two modes: comparing tone between input/output pairs or analyzing tone stability within a single text.

For a usage example, see the [Tone Consistency Examples](/examples/scorers/tone-consistency).

## Parameters

The `createToneScorer()` function does not take any options.

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. See the [MastraScorer reference](./mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## .run() Returns

## Scoring Details

The scorer evaluates sentiment consistency through tone pattern analysis and mode-specific scoring.

### Scoring Process

1. Analyzes tone patterns:
   - Extracts sentiment features
   - Computes sentiment scores
   - Measures tone variations
2. Calculates mode-specific score:
   **Tone Consistency** (input and output):
   - Compares sentiment between texts
   - Calculates sentiment difference
   - Score = 1 - (sentiment_difference / max_difference)
   **Tone Stability** (single input):
   - Analyzes sentiment across sentences
   - Calculates sentiment variance
   - Score = 1 - (sentiment_variance / max_variance)

Final score: `mode_specific_score * scale`

### Score interpretation

(0 to scale, default 0-1)

- 1.0: Perfect tone consistency/stability
- 0.7-0.9: Strong consistency with minor variations
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate consistency with noticeable shifts
- 0.1-0.3: Poor consistency with major tone changes
- 0.0: No consistency - completely different tones
