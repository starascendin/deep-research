# Completeness Scorer

The `createCompletenessScorer()` function evaluates how thoroughly an LLM's output covers the key elements present in the input. It analyzes nouns, verbs, topics, and terms to determine coverage and provides a detailed completeness score.

For a usage example, see the [Completeness Examples](/examples/scorers/completeness).

## Parameters

The `createCompletenessScorer()` function does not take any options.

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. See the [MastraScorer reference](./mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## .run() Returns

## Element Extraction Details

The scorer extracts and analyzes several types of elements:

- Nouns: Key objects, concepts, and entities
- Verbs: Actions and states (converted to infinitive form)
- Topics: Main subjects and themes
- Terms: Individual significant words

The extraction process includes:

- Normalization of text (removing diacritics, converting to lowercase)
- Splitting camelCase words
- Handling of word boundaries
- Special handling of short words (3 characters or less)
- Deduplication of elements

## Scoring Details

The scorer evaluates completeness through linguistic element coverage analysis.

### Scoring Process

1. Extracts key elements:
   - Nouns and named entities
   - Action verbs
   - Topic-specific terms
   - Normalized word forms
2. Calculates coverage of input elements:
   - Exact matches for short terms (â‰¤3 chars)
   - Substantial overlap (>60%) for longer terms

Final score: `(covered_elements / total_input_elements) * scale`

### Score interpretation

(0 to scale, default 0-1)

- 1.0: Complete coverage - contains all input elements
- 0.7-0.9: High coverage - includes most key elements
- 0.4-0.6: Partial coverage - contains some key elements
- 0.1-0.3: Low coverage - missing most key elements
- 0.0: No coverage - output lacks all input elements
