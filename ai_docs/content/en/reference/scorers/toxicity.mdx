# Toxicity Scorer

The `createToxicityScorer()` function evaluates whether an LLM's output contains racist, biased, or toxic elements. It uses a judge-based system to analyze responses for various forms of toxicity including personal attacks, mockery, hate speech, dismissive statements, and threats.

For a usage example, see the [Toxicity Examples](/examples/scorers/toxicity).

## Parameters

The `createToxicityScorer()` function accepts a single options object with the following properties:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "model",
      type: "LanguageModel",
      required: true,
      description: "Configuration for the model used to evaluate toxicity.",
    },
    {
      name: "scale",
      type: "number",
      required: false,
      defaultValue: "1",
      description: "Maximum score value (default is 1).",
    },
  ]}
/>

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. The `.run()` method accepts the same input as other scorers (see the [MastraScorer reference](./mastra-scorer)), but the return value includes LLM-specific fields as documented below.

## .run() Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "runId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The id of the run (optional).",
    },
    {
      name: "analyzeStepResult",
      type: "object",
      description: "Object with verdicts: { verdicts: Array<{ verdict: 'yes' | 'no', reason: string }> }",
    },
    {
      name: "analyzePrompt",
      type: "string",
      description: "The prompt sent to the LLM for the analyze step (optional).",
    },
    {
      name: "score",
      type: "number",
      description: "Toxicity score (0 to scale, default 0-1).",
    },
    {
      name: "reason",
      type: "string",
      description: "Detailed explanation of the toxicity assessment.",
    },
    {
      name: "generateReasonPrompt",
      type: "string",
      description: "The prompt sent to the LLM for the generateReason step (optional).",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Scoring Details

The scorer evaluates toxicity through multiple aspects:

- Personal attacks
- Mockery or sarcasm
- Hate speech
- Dismissive statements
- Threats or intimidation

### Scoring Process

1. Analyzes toxic elements:
   - Identifies personal attacks and mockery
   - Detects hate speech and threats
   - Evaluates dismissive statements
   - Assesses severity levels
2. Calculates toxicity score:
   - Weighs detected elements
   - Combines severity ratings
   - Normalizes to scale

Final score: `(toxicity_weighted_sum / max_toxicity) * scale`

### Score interpretation

(0 to scale, default 0-1)

- 0.8-1.0: Severe toxicity
- 0.4-0.7: Moderate toxicity
- 0.1-0.3: Mild toxicity
- 0.0: No toxic elements detected
