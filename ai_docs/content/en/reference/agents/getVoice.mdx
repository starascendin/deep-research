await agent.getVoice();
```

## Parameters

  content={[
    {
      name: "options",

      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "{}",
      description: "Optional configuration object containing runtime context.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

  content={[
    {
      name: "voice",
      type: "Promise<MastraVoice>",
      description: "A promise that resolves to the voice provider configured for the agent, or a default voice provider if none was configured.",
    },
  ]}
/>

await agent.getVoice({
  runtimeContext: new RuntimeContext()
});
