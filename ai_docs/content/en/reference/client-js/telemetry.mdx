The Telemetry API provides methods to retrieve and analyze traces from your Mastra application. This helps you monitor and debug your application's behavior and performance.

## Getting Traces

Retrieve traces with optional filtering and pagination:

```typescript
const telemetry = await mastraClient.getTelemetry({
  name: "trace-name", // Optional: Filter by trace name
  scope: "scope-name", // Optional: Filter by scope
  page: 1, // Optional: Page number for pagination
  perPage: 10, // Optional: Number of items per page
  attribute: {
    // Optional: Filter by custom attributes
    key: "value",
  },
});
```
