# Memory API

The Memory API provides methods to manage conversation threads and message history in Mastra.

### Get All Threads

Retrieve all memory threads for a specific resource:

```typescript
const threads = await mastraClient.getMemoryThreads({
  resourceId: "resource-1",
  agentId: "agent-1",
});
```

### Create a New Thread

Create a new memory thread:

```typescript
const thread = await mastraClient.createMemoryThread({
  title: "New Conversation",
  metadata: { category: "support" },
  resourceId: "resource-1",
  agentId: "agent-1",
});
```

### Working with a Specific Thread

Get an instance of a specific memory thread:

```typescript
const thread = mastraClient.getMemoryThread("thread-id", "agent-id");
```

## Thread Methods

### Get Thread Details

Retrieve details about a specific thread:

```typescript
const details = await thread.get();
```

### Update Thread

Update thread properties:

```typescript
const updated = await thread.update({
  title: "Updated Title",
  metadata: { status: "resolved" },
  resourceId: "resource-1",
});
```

### Delete Thread

Delete a thread and its messages:

```typescript
await thread.delete();
```

## Message Operations

### Save Messages

Save messages to memory:

```typescript
const savedMessages = await mastraClient.saveMessageToMemory({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Hello!",
      id: "1",
      threadId: "thread-1",
      createdAt: new Date(),
      type: "text",
    },
  ],
  agentId: "agent-1",
});
```

### Retrieve Thread Messages

Get messages associated with a memory thread:

```typescript
// Get all messages in the thread
const { messages } = await thread.getMessages();

// Limit the number of messages retrieved
const { messages } = await thread.getMessages({ limit: 10 });
```

### Delete a Message

Delete a specific message from a thread:

```typescript
const result = await thread.deleteMessage("message-id");
// Returns: { success: true, message: "Message deleted successfully" }
```

### Delete Multiple Messages

Delete multiple messages from a thread in a single operation:

```typescript
const result = await thread.deleteMessages(["message-1", "message-2", "message-3"]);
// Returns: { success: true, message: "3 messages deleted successfully" }
```

### Get Memory Status

Check the status of the memory system:

```typescript
const status = await mastraClient.getMemoryStatus("agent-id");
```
