# Run.streamVNext() (Experimental)

<StreamVNextCallout />

The `.streamVNext()` method enables real-time streaming of responses from a workflow. This enhanced streaming capability will eventually replace the current `stream()` method.

## Usage example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

const stream = run.streamVNext({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data",
  },
});
```

## Parameters

  content={[
    {
      name: "inputData",
      type: "z.infer<TInput>",
      description: "Input data that matches the workflow's input schema",
      isOptional: true,
    },

## Returns

    },
    {

    },
    {

      type: "string",
      isOptional: true,
      description: "The trace ID associated with this execution when AI tracing is enabled.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Extended usage example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

const stream = run.streamVNext({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data",
  },
});

const result = await stream.result;
```

## Stream Events

The stream emits various event types during workflow execution. Each event has a `type` field and a `payload` containing relevant data:

- **`workflow-start`**: Workflow execution begins
- **`workflow-step-start`**: A step begins execution
- **`workflow-step-output`**: Custom output from a step
- **`workflow-step-result`**: A step completes with results
- **`workflow-finish`**: Workflow execution completes with usage statistics
